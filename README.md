# Node Diffusion (working name)

Welcome to another one of my weekend projects exploring how humans can interact with state of the art AI models. This week features a node-graph editor inspired by shader/material editors found in many other creative software. Built using React Flow, zustand, nextjs, cloudflare workers, StabilityAI API, and OpenAI API.

Just make a PR and try to follow the functional paradigm. All skill levels welcome. Let's build AI interactions together :).
